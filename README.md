# Bookstore Application 

## 1. Project Overview:

   Objective: Develop a bookstore application based on the J2EE platform with a simple book model.
   Scope (Iteration 1): User can view a list of books, view individual book details, and basic search functionality.

## 2. Book Model:

   Title: Name of the book.
   Data type: String
   Constraints: Not empty, Maximum length (e.g., 255 characters)

   Author: Writer of the book.
   Data type: String
   Constraints: Not empty, Maximum length (e.g., 100 characters)

   Image: Cover image of the book.
   Data type: URL or Binary Data (BLOB for databases that support it)
   Constraints: Valid URL if stored as URL, Valid image format if stored as binary.

   ISBN (International Standard Book Number):
   Data type: String
   Constraints: Must conform to standard ISBN format (10 or 13 characters).

   Publisher: Publisher of the book.
   Data type: String
   Constraints: Not empty, Maximum length (e.g., 100 characters)

## 3. Functional Requirements:

   Book Listing: A page to display a list of all available books.
   Each book entry should show: Image, Title, Author, and Publisher.
   Clicking on a book should take the user to the book's detail page.
   Book Details: A detailed view of the book when selected from the listing.
   Displays: Image, Title, Author, ISBN, and Publisher.
   Search Functionality: Allow users to search for a book by Title or Author.
   Search results should display relevant books.
   No results feedback should be shown if no matches are found.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements:

   Performance: The application should be responsive with minimal lag when accessing book details.
   Scalability: The design should be scalable, allowing for more books to be added in the future.
   Security: Ensure that the system is secure from common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection.

## 5. Future Enhancements (For subsequent iterations):

   User account management.
   Ability for users to add reviews and ratings.
   Online purchase functionality.

The next steps, post-requirements gathering, would be to design the database schema based on the requirements, set up the development environment, and then start with the implementation phase.
